def newton(f, f_pr, x_0, tol, max_iter):
    # Implements the Newton-Raphson Method, which approximates the roots of a differentiable real-valued function.
    # Parameters:
    #   f is a function that implements f(x). Assume that f takes a single numerical argument and returns a single numerical value.
    #   f_pr is a function that implements fâ€²(x). Assume that f_pr takes a single numerical argument and returns a single numerical value.
    #   x_0 is an initial guess at a root.
    #   tol is the absolute tolerance used to end the recurrence.
    #   max_iter is the maximum number of recurrences.
    # Returns: next, which results from either tol or max iter being reached, as described above.
